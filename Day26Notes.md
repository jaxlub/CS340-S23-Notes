# ***Day 26 - 4/24/2023***

## **Today we had a guest speaker, Samyukta Jadhwani!**

### Samy earned her masters in computer science at the University of Virginia, and from there took a job at Epic, a healthcare software development company. After two years at Epic, she decided to pursue bigger and better things, and took a new position working on Microsoft's data analysis software, *PowerBI*. She has worked at Microsoft for almost 6 years now, and has been promoted to the position *Software Developer II*.

### **How big is the team you work on? How is the hierarchy of roles organized?**
- She first worked on a team of 30 people, with a hierarchy of 4 managers who everyone reported to.
    - This group had lots of of support systems in place
    - Some members of the team had been on the team for 20+ years, providing lots of learning oppurtunities
- Now she works in a much smaller team of about 9 people
    - Every group member has much more responsibility
    - Each person has full ownsership of their code and contributions
        - you are responsible for testing, writing, and editing your code

### **What does a typical day look like on your current team?**
- The longer you work at a company the more meetings you need to attend
    - At this point anywhere from 30% - 75% of her day is spent in meetings
- The rests of the day is spent coding, review code, or occasionally mentoring people


### **What languages do you typically code in?**
- Currently she is working mostly on front-end stuff
   - Working in Javascript, using Angular and React
- Most of the other code written at Microsoft is done in C#
- Sometimes people will write their own Bash scripts for automating tasks

### **Do you prefer working in a bigger team or a smaller one?**
- She prefers a smaller team for multiple reasons:
    - You will learn more
        - You are on your own for many coding tasks
        - You are responsible for wearing many different hats and learning how to perform many different jobs
    - You get to have more control and ownership of your code
- A bigger team might be better for beginners 
    - There will be more support systems and social oppurtunities
    - There are more people to go to for help when 
you need it

### **What skills from school have you found useful in your professional life?**
- Diagrams and flow charts
    - When learning about diagramming code in school it usually seems boring and pointless, but in practice it is very useful for designing code
    - When you first start out in a company you will be more focussed on individual coding tasks, which dont require such thorough planning and diagramming
        - But as a senior developer, Samy does a lot of designing and planning of code, where creating diagrams is super important for understanding how a program is supposed to work

### **Do you enjoy the work you have been doing?**
- Working at Epic was not as enjoyable as Microsoft
    - Epic uses a very outdated language called **M** or MUMPS
    - It was a fairly large company, but still running like a startup
        - Often code planning was not thorough enough and there would be frequent changes to the software plan

### **Why did you decide to go to grad school?**
- She really enjoyed learning about computer science and wanted to go deeper
- She decided to leave with a masters instead of a full PhD
    - Her school tried to get her to pursue a PhD, but she didn't want to publish
    - She did the full course work of a PhD, but didnt publish any papers and left with a Masters
    - Research is a little too open-ended for her

### **Do you have any advice for knowing when to pursue a new job?**
- Are you growing and learning in your current position?
    - If you are not being challenged or learning new things, then it may be time to pursue a new position or a new company
    - If you aren't being challenged you are more likely to become bored and burned-out by your job
- If you coworkers and managers are not supporting you then you may want to swap teams or companies
    - it is better to bite the bullet and ask to swap teams than to stay in a team where you aren't supported or happy
- Also many companies will offer generous sign-on bonusses

### **What are the tradeoffs between a CI/CD apporach and a one time "box release" approach?**
- CI/CD is much better
    - In PowerBI they release a new version every 4 months
    - Every time they release a new version they have to test it against a lot of old releases since users don't always update on time
- They merge commits every week, and these commits are automatically deployed to different regions one by one
- With frequent deployment you get more oppurtunities to test code, and also don't hav as much code to test at once

### **Have you faced any unique challenges as a woman in CS?**
- She has experienced some small biases and such, but she has heard much worse stories than hers
    - It is more likely to experience bias on a larger team
    - If at any point you feel you are being treated unfairly, escalate the situation
        - Talk to your manager
            - If your manager is the issue then go to their manager
    - If you cannot escalate the situation then just leave
        - It is better to get out than stay in a bad situation

### **What types of things do you do in meetings?**
- Cadence meetings
    - Regularly scheduled progress meetings for projects
    - If someone needs help they may bring it up here
    - Or if someone has questions about the tasks they have been assigned
    - Ensure work is going well and good progress is being made
- Design meetings
    - Meetings for planning and deisnging new features of code
    - Senior developers and the Design team come together to create effective and practical plans
    - These can be regularly scheduled while building a new feature to check that the progress being made is aligned with the Design team's plans
- Training meetings
- Brown bag meetings
    - Can be anything, from a book club, to a workshop for learning React.

### **What is the education level of your coworkers?**
- Majority of people only have a bachelors
    - A masters degree might give you a leg up in your application, or allow you to get a higher position right off the bat
- Some people also have MBAs
    - Most of those people are working as a project manager, or a design team member
    - Upper management people will all have MBAs

### **What makes an intern stand out?**
- ASK FOR HELP
    - The squeaky wheel gets the oil
    - You will not be judged for not knowing how to do your assigned tasks
    - You will stand out more by reaching out to people, than by silently completing tasks
- Other than that just complete tasks on time

### **Do you work remote, in-person, or hybrid?**
- She works hybrid, usually going into the office 1-2 days a week
    - Some companies are encouraging people to come back to the office, but microsoft has not done this yet
- Being in-person made it much easier to maintain a work-life balance
    - When you go home at 5, you are done with your work
- Being in-person also makes it easier to ask people for help
    - You can just walk into their office and ask them
    - Being remote, everything has to be a scheduled meeting

### **To wrap up, what general advice would you give the class?**
- Don't stress
    - Life is very long, and you will have many many oppurtinities to pursue many many different things
    - Just take it one step at a time and dont stress too much
