# Lecture day 15,  3/8/23


## INTRODUCTION
- The point of tests is to reveal and prevent bugs.


- Mutation Testing → Seed defects in the code and check which tests reveal the defects.

## How do we seed these defects?
* Change && —> | | —> —	(Make changes to parts of the program)
* Manually seed defects
* Easy to do
* Time consuming
* Potential for bias

**Automatically seed defects → Script/program to modify a program’s source code to seed defects.** 
Mutation operators → templates for replacing code

* (i) if (a < b) → if (a <= b)
* (ii) if (a == b) → if (a |= b)
* (iii) a = b + c → a = b - c
* (iv) f(); g(); → g(); f();
* (v) x = y  → y = x;

## MAIN BODY

- Programs can be represented by trees → Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)
- After we apply a mutation operator, we have a mutant or variant of the project
- The order is the # of mo(changes) applied to a program

----
## What does it mean if a variant is not detected by the test suite?

## Test suite is not good?
* Mutant is actually semantics preserving (did not change the outcome of the program) 
* equivalent mutant programs that are semantically identical and this pass/fail same # of tests

This idea of automatically mutating software is based on the competent programmer hypothesis: 
   * faults are syntactically small and can be corrected with a few keystrokes.

- NB: But - not all bugs are small!
- Coupling effect hypothesis →Complex faults are combinations of small faults (high order mutant)

## What are the drawbacks with  MT?

- Make 1000 mutants
- Run test suite against each mutant
- Record % detected
- Very expensive → run the whole suite 1000 times → more targeted testing.

## The Story so far…
1.	Scripting → automate tasks

2.	Version Control → collaborate and track changes in software

3.	Testing → gain confidence/assure quality

## We want to automate all of the processes needed to take code from commits and move it into production
* Production: code being run by uses.
* The automated infinity loop lifecycle is called Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery CI/CD.

## Continuous Integration

## Definition
- Practice of integrating code changes into the main branch of a shaped repo
- Often automatically testing each change on both commits and merges, 
and automatically building each version .
- Push multiple times a day/merge rebase into the main branch
- Encourages best practices with commits
- Reduce # of long lived branches 
- Reduce merge  conflicts → PR and code review
- The main branch should always be working

---

## CONCLUSION

## Benefits of CI

- Reverts are not costly - only a few changes 
- Integration bugs are detected early
- No “merge day”
- Always have “current” version of the code that is built
- Immediate feedback or system guide impacts


## Continuous Delivery

## Definition
* Process of frequently generating exports/builds of code from the repository that are ready to be deployed
* (Implement → merge → validate )  —>  CI
* (Deploy to pre-prod → Spot checks → Deploy to prod) → CD
* This is a pipeline → Once a version of the source enters the pipeline, it is held constant until deployment
* Version stays the same even if we continue to make commits
* Continuous Deployment → automatically publishing/deployment to production (less common)
